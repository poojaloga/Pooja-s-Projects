# Roll Your Fate Dice Game

This project is a simple, interactive Python script that simulates rolling a 10-sided dice with unique consequences for each roll.

## Description

When the script is run, it prompts the user to roll a virtual 10-sided dice. Depending on the result, the user will face a fun and harmless consequence. For instance, rolling a 1 might result in the user needing to eat a spoon of cinnamon, while a 2 could send them off to buy everyone ice cream.
